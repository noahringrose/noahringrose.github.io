# Hello, I'm Noah

Hi! I'm an incoming physics PhD student at NYU interested broadly in generalized symmetries and topological defects in QFTs and lattice models, and the mathematical classification/characterization of topological phases of matter. I am currently a final year undergraduate in math and physics being mentored by [Adrian Ocneanu] (https://mathpicture.fas.harvard.edu/hrt-course) at Penn State University. I have also done research in tensor categories and topological phases at Ohio State under the supervision of [Dave Penneys] (https://people.math.osu.edu/penneys.2/) and Kyle Kawagoe.

This is my personal website where I hope to share my ideas and perspectives on math and physics and keep track of my progress as a physicist, mathematician, natural philosopher, or whatever I choose to identify myself as on a given day.  

I'm only getting started, but for a first taste of my work, you can check out my senior honors thesis, [Higher Structures from Simple Lattice Models] (/assets/Final Thesis - Noah Ringrose). can check out my [CV](/assets/cv.pdf) if you're curious.

I love talking to anyone with even remotely similar interests to mine, so if you want to chat about anything math or physics related, feel free to reach out via email at noah.ringrose@gmail.com!
