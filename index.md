# Hello, I'm Noah

Hi! I'm an incoming physics PhD student at NYU interested broadly in generalized symmetries and topological defects in QFTs and lattice models, and the mathematical classification/characterization of topological phases of matter. I am currently a final year undergraduate in math and physics being mentored by [Adrian Ocneanu](https://mathpicture.fas.harvard.edu/hrt-course) at Penn State University. I have also done research in tensor categories and topological phases at Ohio State under the supervision of [Dave Penneys](https://people.math.osu.edu/penneys.2/) and Kyle Kawagoe.

This is my personal website where I hope to share my ideas and perspectives on math and physics and keep track of my progress as a physicist, mathematician, natural philosopher, or whatever I choose to identify myself as on a given day.  

I'm only getting started, but for a first taste of my work, you can check out my senior honors thesis, [Higher Structures from Simple Lattice Models](/assets/Final Thesis - Noah Ringrose). I believe that physicists shouldn't have to wait decades for abstract math to be translated into their language; one of my biggest goals is to destigmatize the use of abstract math, like category theory, in physics through the use of visually intuitive mathematical languages. This thesis is a testament to this belief; my goal was to motivate the use of topological defects and fusion categories in physics from the ground up, showing how they naturally arise when studying the simplest classical lattice model â€” the 2d Ising Model. 

If you are curious about my background, you can check out my [CV](/assets/cv.pdf).

I love talking to anyone with even remotely similar interests to mine, so if you want to chat about anything math or physics related, feel free to reach out via email at noah.ringrose@gmail.com!
